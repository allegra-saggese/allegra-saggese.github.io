Current Economics PhD student at UC Santa Cruz. Previously at the International Growth Center (IGC) and the Department of Economics at LSE as a Policy Economist and Research Assistant. Before, I was an Economist at McKinsey & Company (formerly Vivid Economics). 

I hold an MSc in Environmental Economics and Climate Change from the LSE and a BS in Environmental Economics and Policy and BA in Rhetoric from UC Berkeley.

I study how firms in developing countries respond to macro shocks, particularly climate change and trade policy.
