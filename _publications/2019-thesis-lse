title: "The Impact of Wind Development and
Deregulation on Midwestern Electricity
Firms"
collection: publications
category: other
excerpt: 'This is a thesis completed for the fullfillment of the MSc in Enviromental Economics and Climate Change, 
at the London School of Economics (2019).  
I investigates the effect of the rollout of the Integrated Marketplace
in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) on residential electricity prices, conditional on the
structure of the utility provider. We find no significant causal implication between firm structure and residential pricing after the introduction 
of a wholesale electricity market.'
